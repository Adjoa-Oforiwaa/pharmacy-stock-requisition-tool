Pharmacy Stock Requisition Tool

ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This workbook helps to manage stock requisition by calculating shortages and reorder quantities while respecting each itemâ€™s Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ).

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Available â†’ Current stock balance.

Target â†’ Desired stock level (e.g., two weeks supply).

MOQ â†’ Minimum order quantity, based on pack size (14, 28, 60, etc.).

Reorder â†’ Formula that decides how much to order:

If stock < target â†’ order shortage or MOQ (whichever is greater).

If stock â‰¥ target â†’ reorder = 0.

Orders are rounded to nearest MOQ pack size.

ðŸ”¹ Formulas Used

MOQ
=IF([@[AVAILABLE STOCK]]=0,1,IFERROR(XLOOKUP(TRUE, MOD([@[AVAILABLE STOCK]],$L$2:$L$4)=0,$K$2:$K$4),1))

Reorder

=IF([@[TARGET STOCK]]-[@[AVAILABLE STOCK]]>0,MAX([@[TARGET STOCK]]-[@[AVAILABLE STOCK]],[@MOQ]),0)

ðŸ”¹ How to Update

To add a new product, enter its Available and Target.

To add a new MOQ pack size, update the MOQ lookup list (columns H & I).

The formulas will automatically recalculate.

ðŸ”¹ Notes

If #N/A appears â†’ means the itemâ€™s pack size is not in the MOQ lookup list.

Always verify MOQ values before placing final orders.
